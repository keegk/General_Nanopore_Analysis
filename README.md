# General_Nanopore_Analysis

Outlined below are the steps and scripts in the Nanopore shotgun metagenomic pipeline ("The Nanopore pipelin"):

1) Basecalling. See individual results chapter repositories for the different basecalling modular scripts used for each. The outputs of basecalling scripts convert raw FAST5/POD5 Nanopore files into FASTQ files.
2) Concatenating and compressing FASTQ files generated from basecalling
      -compressing_passed_fastq.sh (searches within each of the FAST5/POD5 directories for FASTQ files and concatentates these into a single FASTQ file)
3) Tidying the FASTQ files
      -tool SeqKit is used to remove duplicate reads and then Seqtk is used to convert these tidied FASTQ files into fasta files for BLASTn analysis. Note there are no bash scripts for these tools, they can be used on an interactive job on the HPC. fOR SeqKit: 'seqkit rmdup concat.fastq -s -o clean.fastq'. For Seqtk:'seqkit rmdup concat.fastq -n -o cleanbyID2.fastq.'
 4) READ QC
      - Using a custom R script (read_QC_in_R.Rmd)
      - Nanoplot with Guppy data: Nanoplot_guppy.sh; Nanoplot with Dorado data: dorado_bam_seq_sum.sh and Nanoplot.sh
5) Taxa identification
   
 Both scripts below set the same BLASTn parameters and output the same information in text files, the only difference is one uses single FASTA files as input and the second takes advantage of "array" jobs on a HPC, which allows users to input and process multiple files (in this case FASTA) within a single script:

      -BLAST_ncbi_out7.sh (single fasta files as input)
      -BLAST_ncbi_out7_array.sh (array job that can take multiple fasta files at once)


Filtering of taxonomic hits in BLASTn scripts:
1.	Maximum target hits = 10
2.	Percent identity > 90
3.	E-value â‰¤ 1 x 10-12

6) Concatenating multiple BLASTn text files generated per sample
      - concat_blast_text_files.sh
        
7) Parsing data into R
      - parse_into_R.sh
      - parsefilter_blasttable.R

8) Adding the full taxonomy of reads (from Superkingdom/Domain) in R
